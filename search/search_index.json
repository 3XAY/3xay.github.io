So, Colin naturally became the programmer, which left Ayan and me with no jobs. Then, Ayan remembered that he can make music, so that's what he did, creating 7 custom original soundtracks for this game based on the storyline. Hayden said he'd do the art (which ISN'T MS Paint by the way) so I was the only one left with nothing else to do. </p> <p>I thought for a while, but decided I'll start writing the README and instructions for the game while I think. That's when I started writing a bit of a backstory, and before you knew it, I had become the storyteller.

Colin used some placeholder assets for a while, until Hayden had enough art made to start adding it to the game. </p> <p>We also decided that we wanted to record the voicelines, not just have them appear on screen. So I decided that Hayden should be the voice actor for the main character and the intro narrator, and I ended up being the voice actor for the devil, and the end narrator. When Hayden was done working, he started scouting other teams to see how far along everyone was (hint: everyone, including us, needed more time).</p> <p>Although I was done with my storyline fairly quickly (maybe a few hours after lunch), my work wasn't over. The team still needed me to explain the storyline for them. Sure, they could've read it themselves, but that would mean spending more time, a resource we didn't have, and could also lead to inconsistencies throughout the game. So my work never ended.

While making the schematic, I found it incredibly relaxing to place a few components down and map each individual trace to each component.  </p> <p>The silkscreen on the other hand, was incredibly annoying. After I spent a bunch of time doing the silkscreen, it turns out it was too thin to be printed, so I had to go and redo everything to make sure it was thick enough.

Finally,  after a lot of research, I found a tool that converted the PCB to a file that could be imported into Blender. It's by 30350n, you should go check it out. The only problem with this tool was that the textures, although super high-quality, were incredibly laggy, so I spent a lot of time making my own textures, which is why it doesn't look great.</p> <p>But after the PCB was fully modeled (thanks to PonderSlime for the 3D models for the parts), it was time to design the actual case. To be honest, I was actually procrastinating a lot because this is the part I got stuck on for my last macropad, so it was a bit scary. Thankfully, I had lots of guides this time, and it was a much simpler design. I started with the bottom, and then used that to make the switch plate and top plate. I had some problems (I didn't make enough holes in the switch plate) and I forgot to make the acrylic 3mm thick, but in the end, I caught all of my errors and was done with the plate. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/HackPad/#step-3-firmware","title":"Step 3: Firmware","text":"<p>This is the part that I thought would be the easiest, but oh boy was I wrong.

Little did I know that making the RP2040 SMD would be an absolute PAIN to solder on, considering that the LEDs were right behind it. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Pixeldust/#creating-the-firmware","title":"Creating the firmware","text":"<p>Creating the firmware was really simple. I only had to worry about taking input from the buttons and encoder, and then changing some RGBW + brightness values. It was pretty simple to use the built-in CircuitPython libraries to handle the buttons + encoders. After that, I just had to create and update the RGBW variables and use the brightness as a multiplier. Finally, I could use the built-in Neopixel library to send the right data through the data pins to update the LEDs. Finally, I also created some \"profiles\" that allow you to quickly cycle through some presets that you may find useful.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Pixeldust/#putting-it-all-together","title":"Putting it all together","text":"<p>CADing a case is always a bit of nightmare for me. Since I use Blender, which is definitely not optimized for CAD, it can be a little annoying to change some things after the fact, but overall it wasn't horrible. Unfortunately, when I 3D-printed my case, there was a decent bit of warping, which meant that the dimensions weren't as accurate as possible. Plus, when I was soldering the Xiao RP2040 onto the board, I realized that it was IMPOSSIBLE because I didn't make it THT, and the SMD LEDs were on the other side. This meant that I had to make sure to solder it perfectly, which ended up being hard since the pads were so close together. In the end, I had to use a normal Raspberry Pi RP2040 and use wires to connect the pins to the right pads. I also ended up destroying some pads in the process of trying to connect the Xiao, so I have some extra wires sticking out. All in all, this made the fully enclosed case difficult. My solution? Get rid of the diffusion layer, it looks the same anyways + is brighter.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Pixeldust/#magic-smoke","title":"Magic smoke","text":"<p>If you've ever worked with circuits, you're familiar with the term \"magic smoke\". For those of you who don't know, it's when a component burns up and releases that smoke. You see, I forgot that I needed a diode for my power delivery, so thankfully when I plugged it into a USB-port, it just shorted out safely. Unfortunately, I didn't have a powerful enough diode. Thankfully, I found a 400V, 1A diode from a dead board of some sort. I put it on, but remember, this lightbox uses the full 3 amps at max load. So, as you'd expect, the diode started smoking. Now, I could just get a proper diode, OR I could use one of the many mini heatsinks I have and call it a day. And who would've thought, it actually worked! Even at max load for extended durations!</p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Pixeldust/#the-result","title":"The result","text":"<p>Overall, it ended up pretty good. Sure, it looks a little weird, but it works! If I were to make this again, I would think a little harder about the microcontroller placement, adding the right diodes, and making the USB-C port compatible with USB-PD chargers by adding resistors on the CC pins (which this port doesn't have). Some nice quality of life improvements would be an integrated battery, wireless control, more / brighter lights (possible with USB-C PD or just limiting the brightness depending on the actual power usage) and also a few pads that I can use for powering other devices. I actually ended up powering a dead battery-powered toy truck with the exposed 5V power inputs. All in all, I'm pretty happy with the project. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/asylum-weather/","title":"Weather Station | Asylum","text":"<p>A weather station proof of concept working on the Hack Club Sprig.

Thankfully, it was announced ahead of time, meaning we could plan ahead. Devansh and I knew that we had to do a hardware project for a few reasons. Firstly, it's the most impressive and fun. Secondly, I have a lot of tools and electronics that we could use to make something pretty cool. Thirdly, it's great to learn how to go through the entire engineering process in such a short timespan. We stayed after school for an hour at the library to think of ideas based on what I had and we finally settled on a weather station.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#brainstorming","title":"Brainstorming","text":"<p>I ended up doing most of the brainstorming myself after some state field testing (on Halloween), so I had a lot of time to think of how everything would work together. I grabbed a scrap piece of paper, my pens, and my highlighters and got right to work. I knew I had to have two parts, a \"node\" that would actually collect and send the data, and a server that would receive, process, and display that data. I ended up creating a diagram of both along with their functions and some notes about each function. (Watch the YouTube video for a full explanation). On the back, I thought of some things to put on the screen and how that would all function with the buttons. Overall, I felt pretty confident in my ideas by the end of it.</p> <p> </p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#the-morning","title":"The Morning","text":"<p>I woke up early on November 1st, ready to go.

That means that if I want to connect my hard drive to it, I either need an adapter to Micro-USB (which I somehow don't have), permanently attach the drive's wire to the Pi (which is a horrible idea), or find a way to add a port. Thankfully, there's some test points that allow you to add a port, the problem is I don't have one. So there I was, trying to strip the wires of a USB-A splitter, which, for some reason, loved to KEEP. FREAKING. BREAKING. At this point, I was honestly fed up (even Devansh tried and couldn't strip it / solder the wires without them breaking instantly) and decided to go to CVS to see if they had any adapters. No luck. Then I went to an office supply store, no luck again. Thankfully that fresh air helped me realize that I could try to break the plastic housing around the connector itself and use the pins on the PCB rather than the wires coming off of it. Unfortunately, I ended up getting a pretty gnarly gash on my finger which made it a LITTLE harder to type and work with my tools. The worst part is that I did something similar while trying to open something else with the exact same screwdriver, and the result was the exact same. Anyways, I finally managed to get the connector open, was able to solder the wires easily, and plug everything together. (Connecting the hard drive itself is gonna be a whole 'nother section because of how insanely stupid it was).</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#and-now-we-feast","title":"And now, we feast!","text":"<p>It was finally lunch time. I ate two slices of pepperoni pizza along with a cookie. I honestly don't really know what kind of cookie it was, but it appeared to have a marshmallow filling. After that, Devansh and I thought that we should get a treat before we continue working, so we began our journey to Halo Pub. For those of you who don't know, Halo Pub is THE ice cream spot at Princeton. They also have coffee, hot cocoa, and cider (during the fall season). Basically, they've got a lot of stuff and it's amazing and fresh. We actually ended up getting the same thing because it was his first time there and I ALWAYS get the ice cream so I wanted something different. I'd never heard of this, but we both got a hot cocoa float. I got mine with coffee ice cream and it was amazing. The whipped cream added a nice bit of flavor that contrasted well with the blend of hot chocolate and cold coffee to create a heavenly elixir. Anyways, we finished eating/drinking it on the way back and got back to work.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#hard-drives-are-hard","title":"Hard Drives Are Hard","text":"<p>Now, back to the hard drive. Although I had physically gotten all of the wires soldered in the right spots for the USB port, and I could tell the drive was receiving power, I couldn't actually see the drive at all. Listing active drives showed nothing, regardless of what command I used. I couldn't find any Seagate drives. However, after a lot of trial and error, I ran a command that allowed me to see each drive's ID. <code>ls -l /dev/disk/by-id</code>. Finally! I saw the Seagate drive and its path. I could finally properly initialize the drive, which let us actually store the sensor data over there.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#makin-mountains","title":"Makin' Mountains","text":"<p>The CAD was actually pretty fun. I tried using a different mechanism to attach one half of the case to the other. I had brought heatset inserts but really didn't want to use them, knowing how finicky they can be. I ended up having protrusions from the sides of the cases with a small hole, perfectly sized for a screw and nut. By putting matching protrusions on the top and bottom of the cases, I could easily and quickly tighten them down, without too much work in CAD or too much assembly time. Originally, I was only gonna make the server case while Devansh made the node case, but he was really struggling with Blender. He even tried going to the Blender workshop but it just didn't click for him. I even tried making a little cheat-sheet for him so that he could see all of the commands, but the fundamentals themselves weren't compatible with him. Thankfully, I was able to quickly make his case, and ended up opting for a design where it's just a box and everything HAS to fit in there, regardless of how. I just made some holes on the top for the LEDs along with 2 holes on the bottom for the electrodes. I even ended up getting a little fancy and made some slots on the inside of the case that would allow you to easily solder to the tops of the screws after they're already fully installed. My case, on the other hand, needed to look good. It was what you interacted with, you had to see it all of the time. Devansh, for some reason, couldn't get it in his head that we weren't building a PORTABLE SERVER but just a simple server. After I took care of that, I was able to start designing the case in a way that made sense for the both of us. First, I started with the hard drive, turning that into the bottom of the case itself. Then, I worked on the top where the screen and buttons would go. I also needed to put the Pi and the wires somewhere, so I made some space between the top and bottom and used that cavity as the storage. Originally, there were going to be standoffs that were printed, but they were too thin to be viable, hence why there are some indentations on the final print. Finally, I had to make the mountains themselves. I asked Devansh to take my tablet and sketch something out, and then I put my headphones on and started tracing. After enough time, I got a good model made, but I had to figure out how to get the snow and grass as two different parts. I only had white PETG and green PLA, with the PETG having some printing issues. Thankfully, I was able to create two parts that glued together to create some beautiful mountains, after shaving the edges down a bit with my deburring tool. At last, I had finally designed a case that was functional, compact, and aesthetic.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#no-adc-no-problem","title":"No ADC? No Problem!","text":"<p>Looks aren't everything, though. We had some MAJOR problems with the node. We were confident that the Pi would have analog inputs that we never even bothered to check. Surprise! They don't. So now what? Thankfully we had my Wemos C3 Mini. This meant temporarily getting rid of any/all internet access to the server, but it let us have SOMETHING for a node. The C3 Mini had just enough pins for everything to work, and after some fairly annoying soldering, it was ready. At this point, it was pretty close to submission time and we were rushing to port the code to Micropython. Thankfully, we got it done in time.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#printing","title":"Printing","text":"<p>While all of this was going, I was running between our table and upstairs where the A1 Mini was. Here's the thing, I started printing around midnight, which is completely fine. That is, until you realize how many vertical components are on my case, and the poor condition of the printer. That meant that my PETG would warp and fail no matter what. I even brought my own build plate but it still didn't work. The nozzle (which I didn't bring) was fully destroyed, and it was far too late to get one from home now. This meant that I had to be dialling in my print settings and speeds to get everything right, especially with my failed prints and design iterations. I actually got the last print (part of the node case) done a few minutes AFTER the submission time, which is exactly why it's not in the demo video. Thankfully, the prints actually turned out decent when I used Bambu Labs' own filament.</p>","tags":["hackathon"]},{"location":"blog/youtube/tech/hackphs/#presenting","title":"Presenting","text":"<p>After we submitted, it came time to present.

Devansh and I were shocked and were super happy with that, and then we asked, \"So does that mean we won\"? He simply responded with \"Yes\" and that was it. We genuinely couldn't believe it! I quickly set up my phone and tripod to record the closing ceremony (unbeknownst to me, my storage was almost full) as we waited for our names to be called. Every single minute felt like hours.
