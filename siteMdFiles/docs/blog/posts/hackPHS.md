### What is HackPHS?
HackPHS is Princeton High School's annual 24-hour hackathon, organized by students. It is hosted every year at Princeton High School, on Princeton University's campus. This year (2025) was their return from a three-year long hiatus. The best part is that people from all across New Jersey came to participate and it was completely free, thanks to the sponsors!


### The Theme
The theme this year was nature, communication, and "Into the Mountains". Thankfully, it was announced ahead of time, meaning we could plan ahead.
Devansh and I knew that we had to do a hardware project for a few reasons. Firstly, it's the most impressive and fun. Secondly, I have a lot of tools and electronics that we could use to make something pretty cool. Thirdly, it's great to learn how to go through the entire engineering process in such a short timespan. We stayed after school for an hour at the library to think of ideas based on what I had and we finally settled on a weather station.


### Brainstorming
I ended up doing most of the brainstorming myself after some state field testing (on Halloween), so I had a lot of time to think of how everything would work together. I grabbed a scrap piece of paper, my pens, and my highlighters and got right to work. I knew I had to have two parts, a "node" that would actually collect and send the data, and a server that would recieve, process, and display that data. I ended up creating a diagram of both along with their functions and some notes about each function. (Watch the [YouTube video for a full explanation](https://youtu.be/lAx5NC4DJYQ?si=w4mqVtAjkIYbv8zw&t=81)).
