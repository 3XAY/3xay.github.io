### **the** portable windows utility

If you use Windows, you know the pain of maintaining it, making sure your computer is running as normal, and fixing it if it isn't. Plus, setting up a new computer and making sure that's all good also takes some work. That's why I made PC-Utilities. It's an app that you can easily load onto a USB drive and will work across Windows 10 and Windows 11 (most of it even works with Windows 7!)

### What does it do?
Great question! It has a *ton* of functions. You can create system backups with restore points, cleanup and defragment your drives, update & benchmark Windows, and even quickly complete some common registry edits! You can find the full list at the [GitHub wiki.](https://github.com/3XAY/PC-Utilities/wiki)


### How do I use it?
You can get setup in three simple steps!

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/3XAY/PC-Utilities/releases) on the Github & download the installer.
2. Run the downloaded installer.
3. Move the output folder to your USB drive and use it everywhere!


### The Creation
I got tired of constantly having to search through my notes for that one registry edit, or just pressing the same buttons again and again on various computers. So what do you do when you have to do the same thing again and again? Make an app! I fired up Visual Studio Code and got to work. I learned how to use PyQt5 with QT Designer which powered the UI. This project was my way of learning how to properly use GitHub with the Wiki, releases page, and the README. I also learned how to make it easy for others to make their own modifications to the app with my [dev page.](https://github.com/3XAY/PC-Utilities/blob/main/DEV.md) This project wasn't just to solve a problem, but to learn how to share it with everyone.
