# 3xay.github.io - My Personal Website
#### 3XAY (Ayan Bindal)

Welcome to my website!
All written in a mix of Markdown, HTML, and CSS.
Probably ~80% Markdown, ~10% HTML, and ~10% CSS.

This is built using [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org). It's a tool that allows you to quickly build project documentation with Markdown.
Although my website isn't a project, it's kinda like my documentation. I use Markdown to create most of the content on the website.
The beauty of this system is that I can easily and quickly make my website, and then I can use some HTML and CSS later to enhance small portions, creating a nice and simple website
I also use the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) (but modified a LOT). It's a great theme because it's fast, has lots of features, and really lets you customize it.
But... That's also its downside, it takes a LONG time to modify it. I switched from [the Simple-Blog theme by Fernando Celmer](https://github.com/FernandoCelmer/mkdocs-simple-blog) and it took a lot of work to get it to be similar.
But now, it features a code-like aesthetic, which is pretty similar to the Simple-Blog theme. With a lot of CSS modifications and using the HTML partials feature from Material, I was able to get it pretty close to what I wanted.
My favorite parts are the blog and search. The blog took a while to setup, but was worth it, while the search was only a few minutes of work and is super nice and REALLY fast.

Fully open-source so you can see how it all works.
Feel free to use this as a template for your own needs.

(The testServer.bat file is for development use only, replace the
Conda environment with yours and the path to the Mkdocs project with yours)

You may have to run the .bat commands manually in Anaconda Prompt if conda isn't recognized as a command in command prompt. (But this should be fixed now)
