<h3 id="what-is-a-macropad">What is a Macropad?</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="https://3xay.github.io/assets/HackPad/RenderSideView.png">
A macropad is a mini keyboard with only a few keys. (6 in my case). Now, you might be wondering what a keyboard with only 6 keys is good for, and that's a great question!
It's not really meant to be used as a standalone keyboard, but WITH your existing keyboard! Now you might be wondering why you would ever need a keyboard for your keyboard.</p>
<p>Well, you know how <code>CTRL+C</code> and <code>CTRL+V</code> are copy and paste? There are actually lots of combos like that, and they can be huge timesavers!
I personally use them to do things like open Task Manager, switch between tabs, close windows, open tabs in a new window, render in Blender and SO MUCH MORE!</p>
<p>The best part about a macropad is that it can do anything you want it to! Need it to do a specific mouse action? Done. Need it to type a long string of words that you use a lot? Done.
Need to do a simple key combo? Done! Macropads are such <strong>AMAZING</strong> tools, so why don't we make one?

<h3 id="step-1-designing-the-pcb">Step 1: Designing the PCB</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="https://3xay.github.io/assets/HackPad/FinishedPCB.png">
The very first step is to design the PCB, which was actually my favorite part. I've never actually dealt with PCBs or their designs, so learning that was a challenge at first.
Eventually, with some guides and tutorials, I got the hang of KiCad. I made a few revisions (3 revisions to be exact) of my PCB schematic until I got all of the features I wanted.
While making the schematic, I found it incredibly relaxing to place a few components down and map each individual trace to each component.
<img align="left" src="https://3xay.github.io/assets/HackPad/PCB3DViewFrontWithModels.png"> </p>
<p>The silkscreen on the other hand, was incredibly annoying. After I spent a bunch of time doing the silkscreen, it turns out it was too thin to be printed, so I had to go and redo everything to make sure it was thick enough.
The good part, however, is that in the end, I got a fully functional and fairly aesthetic PCB that I was proud of.
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<h3 id="step-2-making-the-case">Step 2: Making the Case</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="https://3xay.github.io/assets/HackPad/finishedCaseTopDown.png">
I'm personally very comfortable in Blender, which is why that's what I used to make my case. The very first problem I faced was importing
the PCB design from KiCad to Blender. It was fairly easy to do in other CAD software, but kinda annoying to do in Blender. Finally, 
after a lot of research, I found a tool that converted the PCB to a file that could be imported into Blender. It's by <a href="https://github.com/30350n/pcb2blender">30350n</a>, you should go check it out.
The only problem with this tool was that the textures, although super high-quality, were incredibly laggy, so I spent a lot of time making my own textures, which is why it doesn't look great.</p>
<p>But after the PCB was fully modeled (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/PonderSlime/">PonderSlime</a> for the 3D models for the parts), it was time to design the actual case.
To be honest, I was actually procrastinating a lot because this is the part I got stuck on for my last macropad, so it was a bit scary. Thankfully, I had lots of guides this time,
and it was a much simpler design. I started with the bottom, and then used that to make the switch plate and top plate. I had some problems (I didn't make enough holes in the switch plate)
and I forgot to make the acrylic 3mm thick, but in the end, I caught all of my errors and was done with the plate.

<p>This is the part that I thought would be the easiest, but oh boy was I wrong. Turns out, firmware is <b>hard</b>, like <i>really</i> hard...
Because I had a QMK compatible MCU (Microcontroller Unit), I thought it would be smooth sailing from here, but I seemed to have forgotten that I need to actually set it up.</p>
<p>And the worst part, was that my macropad was incredibly weird. Most people have 0 or 1 knobs, I had 3... Most people don't tend to have a screen, I did...
And the most important part is most people tend to use matrix wiring, I used direct wiring... (learn about the difference <a href="https://youtu.be/V0M98DuhhBI?si=TxXg1oUVK2Hfz1gU&t=393">here</a>). Basically, all of these small problems added up and made it super hard to learn QMK.
On top of that, the submission date was almost here and I needed something. I ended up making a custom firmware in CircuitPython,  which was pretty rushed.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-assembly">Step 4: Assembly</h3>
<p>My hackpad got shipped, but was missing some parts. Thankfully, I was able to solder the screen (backwards because I messed up the footprint) and 3 encoder switches with 1 rotary encoder working.
After a few firmware tweaks, the stuff I had so far was working. Unfortunately my case was half missing, and I didn't have any switches + I/O expander. This was also my first time soldering, so it took a sec.
I also didn't have a fume extractor or even a fan at the time so the fumes kept on going straight in my lungs...</p>
<h4 id="will-not-be-completed">WILL NOT BE COMPLETED :(</h4>
<p>I've poured a tremendous amount of time and energy into this project, and I've learned a lot and am grateful to Hack Club for providing me this opportunity, HOWEVER, I have noticed that I have made serious design flaws such as a reversed OLED connector and much more.
It does not make sense to continue development on this project at this time, given that I no longer have a strong need for a macropad and a future revision with wireless capabilities + my better understanding of PCB design to improve the build and usability.
By the way, it did end up working, I just had a missing part + the screen had to be mounted behind the macropad, so the code all worked, just not the full thing.</p>
